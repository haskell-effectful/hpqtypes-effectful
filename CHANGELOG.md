# hpqtypes-effectful-1.2.0.0 (????-??-??)
* Compatibility with `hpqtypes` >= 1.15.0.0.
* Rename the `WithNewConnection` constructor of the `DB` effect to
  `WithNewSession`, to match the rename of `withNewConnection` to
  `withNewSession` in `hpqtypes`.
* A database session is now bound to the thread that started it. If another
  thread runs a query in that session, the query throws `ThreadMismatchError`.
  To run queries from another thread, start a separate session there with
  `withNewSession`.
